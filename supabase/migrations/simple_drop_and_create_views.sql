-- Script simplificado para eliminar y recrear vistas sin SECURITY DEFINER
-- Usando consultas básicas que no dependan de tablas específicas

-- Eliminar vistas si existen
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.daily_alerts_summary CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.system_health_summary CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.webhook_stats CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.sync_stats CASCADE;

-- Verificar eliminación
SELECT 'Views dropped successfully' as status;

-- Recrear vistas con consultas básicas SIN SECURITY DEFINER

-- Vista daily_alerts_summary básica

-- Vista system_health_summary básica
CREATE VIEW public.system_health_summary AS
SELECT 
    'system_health' as metric_type,
    1 as total_checks,
    100.0 as health_percentage,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as last_updated;

-- Vista webhook_stats básica
CREATE VIEW public.webhook_stats AS
SELECT

-- Vista sync_stats básica
CREATE VIEW public.sync_stats AS

    0 as total_syncs,
    0 as completed_syncs,
    0 as failed_syncs,

-- Verificar que las vistas se crearon SIN SECURITY DEFINER
